Suggested Parser Tests for Marquee Animation DSL
Here's a comprehensive set of tests we could implement to thoroughly validate the parser functionality:
1. Basic Movement Commands
Move with Coordinates: Test MOVE(10, 50) for explicit coordinate movement
Two-Dimensional Movement: Test MOVE(10, 50, 20, 30) for 2D coordinate movement
Direction Constants: Test all directions - LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN
Move with Options: Test step, interval, easing options (e.g., {step=2, interval=3, easing=linear})
Reset Position: Test with different modes (seamless, instant, fade)
2. Control Flow
Basic Loop: Test finite loop count LOOP(5) {...} END;
Infinite Loop: Test LOOP(INFINITE) {...} END;
Named Loop: Test LOOP(10 AS main_loop) {...} END;
If Statement: Test simple condition IF(widget.x > 100) {...} END;
If-Else: Test with else branch
If-Elseif-Else: Test multiple conditional branches
Break Statement: Test break inside loops
Continue Statement: Test continue inside loops
Nested Control Flow: Test loops inside if statements and vice versa
3. High-Level Commands
Scroll Command: Test with various options
Slide Command: Test all actions (IN, OUT, IN_OUT) with all directions
Popup Command: Test with custom delays and options
High-level Command Combinations: Test sequences of high-level commands
4. Timeline Optimization
Period Statement: Test PERIOD(100) declaration
Start At: Test START_AT(10) for delayed start
Segment: Test SEGMENT(name, start, end) {...} END;
Position At: Test position calculations POSITION_AT(t) => {...} END;
Schedule At: Test scheduled actions SCHEDULE_AT(50, action);
Variable Change Handling: Test ON_VARIABLE_CHANGE(var) {...} END;
Multiple Variable Monitoring: Test ON_VARIABLE_CHANGE([var1, var2]) {...} END;
5. Synchronization
Sync Event: Test SYNC(event); declaration
Wait For: Test WAIT_FOR(event, ticks); with timeout
Multiple Sync Points: Test coordination between multiple sync points
6. Expressions
Property Access: Test widget and container property access
Arithmetic Operations: Test addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
Complex Expressions: Test nested expressions with parentheses
Function Calls: Test built-in function references
7. Error Handling & Edge Cases
Syntax Errors: Test recovery from various syntax errors
Semantic Errors: Test validation of incorrect semantics
Empty Program: Test parsing an empty string
Large Programs: Test parsing large files with many statements
Complex Nesting: Test deeply nested control structures
Comments: Test parsing with different comment styles (single and multi-line)
Whitespace Handling: Test parsing with various whitespace patterns
8. Complete Animation Sequences
Marquee Scroll: Test a complete text scrolling animation
Popup Animation: Test a complete popup animation sequence
Multi-widget Coordination: Test coordinated animations with multiple parts
Would you like to start with implementing a specific subset of these tests, or would you prefer to add more categories or test ideas first?
