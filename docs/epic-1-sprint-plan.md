## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Today)
1. **Assign Story 1.1** to Developer Agent for implementation
2. **Create Story 1.2** detailed story file with DSL validation requirements
3. **Create Story 1.3** detailed story file with migration tool enhancement
4. **Create Story 1.4** detailed story file with widget foundation

### Development Workflow
1. **Story 1.1 Implementation** (Day 1)
   - Developer Agent implements foundation components
   - Technical Lead reviews and approves
   - Foundation ready for subsequent stories

2. **Parallel Development** (Days 2-3)
   - Story 1.2 (DSL Validation) and Story 1.3 (Migration Tool) can run in parallel
   - Both depend on Story 1.1 foundation
   - Cross-validation between DSL design and migration tool output

3. **Integration Phase** (Day 4)
   - Story 1.4 (Widget Foundation) integrates all previous work
   - End-to-end testing of complete foundation
   - Performance validation on target hardware

4. **Epic Completion** (Day 5)
   - Final integration testing
   - Documentation updates
   - Epic acceptance criteria validation
   - Handoff to Epic 2

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 4 stories completed with Definition of Done met
- [ ] DSL validation demonstrates superior developer experience
- [ ] Migration tool generates clean DSL applications
- [ ] Basic widget rendering pipeline functional and tested
- [ ] Foundation architecture supports Epic 2 requirements
- [ ] Performance baseline established for 60fps target
- [ ] All tests passing with >90% coverage
