# PM Phase Handoff Summary - tinyDisplay Project

**Date:** December 2024  
**PM:** Marcus Chen (BMAD PM Persona)  
**Phase:** Product Requirements Document (PRD) Complete  

---

## Key Deliverables Created

### 1. Complete PRD Document
**Location:** `bmad-agent/data/tinyDisplay-PRD.md`
- Comprehensive 10-section PRD covering all aspects of the refactor
- Technical specifications based on Timmy's architectural foundation
- Clear scope definition with MVP features and timeline
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### 2. Critical Architectural Decisions Made

**Full Migration Approach Confirmed:**
- No backward compatibility layer
- Complete migration to ring buffer + SQLite + asteval architecture
- Clean break from legacy codebase

**DSL-First Development Strategy:**
- Pure DSL approach (no JSON configuration dependencies)
- Animation DSL extending marquee patterns to all widgets
- Clear framework vs application responsibility separation

**Library Architecture Clarified:**
- tinyDisplay is embedded within larger applications
- Framework handles rendering, data, DSL parsing
- Applications handle business logic, data sources, orchestration

### 3. Enhanced Epic Planning
**Migration Tool Integration:** Added to Epic 1 for DSL validation
- Extend Timmy's tool to generate DSL applications vs JSON
- Validate developer experience through DSL usability testing
- Ensure migration tool supports complex legacy applications

## Key Technical Specifications

### Performance Targets
- **60fps** sustained on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (512MB RAM)
- **<100MB** memory footprint for typical applications
- **<50ms** response time for dynamic value updates
- **Display range:** 80x16 to 256x256 resolution support

### Core MVP Features
1. **Reactive Widget System** - Text, Image, ProgressBar, Shapes, Collections
2. **Advanced Animation Coordination** - sync(), wait_for(), barrier(), sequence()
3. **Pure DSL Application Definition** - Canvas composition, z-order, transparency
4. **High-Performance Data Layer** - Ring buffers + SQLite + reactive binding
5. **Expression Evaluation System** - asteval integration with dependency tracking
6. **Migration Tool Integration** - DSL validation and legacy conversion

### Timeline
- **~35 days** total (February 2025 target)
- **5 weekly epics** with clear acceptance criteria
- **Epic 1 focus:** Foundation + DSL validation + Migration tool enhancement

## Critical Design Decisions

### Animation Coordination System
- Extend existing marquee DSL patterns to all widget types
- Support sophisticated coordination primitives
- Enable precise frame timing and state-based triggers
- Maintain flexibility for complex professional display scenarios

### Canvas Composition Patterns
- Widget positioning with coordinate systems
- Z-order management for layering
- Dynamic visibility and transparency controls
- Canvas sequence management for rotating displays
- Animation capabilities for both widgets and canvases

### Framework Responsibilities
**tinyDisplay Framework:**
- Widget rendering and animation engine
- Data layer and reactive binding
- DSL parsing and validation
- Performance optimization
- Canvas management and composition

**Application Responsibilities:**
- Business logic and data sources
- Application-specific configurations
- Display sequence orchestration
- External system integration
- Application data schema validation

## Next Steps & Handoff Requirements

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Technical Lead Handoff** - Provide PRD to development team
2. **Epic 1 Sprint Planning** - Break down into detailed development tasks
3. **Environment Setup** - Development and testing infrastructure
4. **Stakeholder Review** - Final scope and timeline approval

### Development Team Handoff Package
- ✅ Complete PRD with technical specifications
- ✅ Timmy's migration tool and architectural foundation
- ✅ Legacy codebase analysis requirements
- ✅ Performance testing framework requirements
- ✅ DSL validation and testing strategy

### Success Criteria for Handoff
- [ ] Development team understands all requirements
- [ ] Technical architecture is clear and approved
- [ ] Timeline and milestones are realistic and agreed upon
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies are in place
- [ ] Quality and testing standards are established

---

## Risk Mitigation Priorities

### High-Priority Risks
1. **Performance targets** - Early prototyping and incremental optimization
2. **DSL complexity** - Extensive user testing and iterative design
3. **Migration tool scope** - Incremental development with manual fallbacks

### Quality Assurance Strategy
- **Test coverage target:** >90%
- **Performance regression prevention:** Automated testing
- **DSL usability validation:** User testing in Epic 1
- **Migration tool validation:** Legacy application testing
