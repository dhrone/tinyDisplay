# tinyDisplay Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** December 2024  
**Product Manager:** Marcus Chen (BMAD PM Persona)  
**Project:** tinyDisplay Framework Refactor  

---

## Section 1: Problem Statement & Context

### Current State
tinyDisplay is a specialized display framework for Single Board Computers (SBCs) with small displays (under 256x256 resolution). The project is currently in a **mid-refactor state** with core components failing unit tests and requiring architectural modernization.

### The Problem
The existing codebase has accumulated technical debt and architectural limitations that prevent it from achieving its performance and usability goals:

- **Performance bottlenecks** preventing 60fps on resource-constrained devices
- **Incomplete widget system** lacking modern reactive patterns
- **Limited animation coordination** capabilities for professional embedded displays
- **Fragmented architecture** that doesn't leverage modern Python patterns
- **Developer experience gaps** in DSL design and application composition

### Strategic Decision: Full Migration Approach
Based on architectural analysis by Timmy (BMAD Architect), we've decided to pursue a **complete migration to a new reactive architecture** rather than incremental refactoring. This approach:

- Eliminates technical debt completely
- Enables modern reactive patterns from the ground up
- Provides clean foundation for advanced features
- Avoids compatibility layer complexity
- Accelerates long-term development velocity

### Migration Foundation
The new architecture leverages:
- **Ring Buffers** for high-performance data flow
- **SQLite** for efficient state management
- **asteval** for safe expression evaluation
- **Reactive patterns** for automatic dependency tracking
- **Multiprocessing** for performance optimization

## Section 5: Technical Assumptions & Constraints

### Development Constraints
- **Timeline:** ~35 days for MVP completion (February 2025)
- **Platform:** Python 3.8+ (Raspberry Pi compatibility)
- **IDE:** Cursor IDE for development
- **Testing:** pytest framework for comprehensive testing
- **Distribution:** PyPI package distribution

### Performance Constraints
- **Target Hardware:** Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (512MB RAM, ARM Cortex-A53)
- **Memory Budget:** <100MB for typical applications
- **Performance Target:** 60fps sustained performance
- **Display Range:** 80x16 to 256x256 resolution support

### Architectural Constraints
- **No backward compatibility** required (clean break approach)
- **Dependency minimization** - careful evaluation of all external dependencies
- **Core functionality isolation** - prevent unnecessary dependencies in core components
- **Library architecture** - tinyDisplay is embedded within larger applications, not standalone

### Dependency Management Principles

**Minimal Dependency Strategy:**
Given the embedded device constraints (512MB RAM on Pi Zero 2W), every dependency must be strictly justified and evaluated for necessity. The framework follows a "prove the need" approach rather than "just in case" inclusion.

**Core Dependencies (Required):**
- `asteval>=0.9.28` - Safe expression evaluation for DSL (security requirement)
- `pillow>=9.0.0` - Image processing and pixel operations (core functionality)

**Dependency Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Necessity Test:** Does the dependency solve a problem that cannot be reasonably solved with existing dependencies or native Python?
2. **Memory Impact:** What is the memory footprint on embedded devices? (Target: each dependency <5MB)
3. **Functionality Overlap:** Does it duplicate capabilities already available in approved dependencies?
4. **Embedded Compatibility:** Is it tested and reliable on ARM-based SBCs?
5. **Maintenance Burden:** Is the dependency actively maintained with security updates?

**Rejected Dependencies (with Rationale):**
- `numpy` - Removed due to 15-20MB memory overhead without clear use case (see NUMPY_REMOVAL_DECISION.md)
- `pandas` - Too heavy for embedded use, data operations handled by SQLite
- `matplotlib` - Rendering handled by Pillow, unnecessary complexity
- `requests` - Not needed for core framework, applications can add if required

**Dependency Addition Process:**
1. **Technical Justification:** Document specific functionality that cannot be achieved otherwise
2. **Memory Analysis:** Measure actual memory impact on Pi Zero 2W
3. **Alternative Evaluation:** Demonstrate why existing solutions are insufficient
4. **Community Review:** Get approval from Technical Lead and stakeholders
5. **Documentation Update:** Update all relevant documentation and examples

**Development vs Runtime Dependencies:**
- **Development dependencies** (pytest, black, flake8, mypy) are acceptable for tooling
- **Runtime dependencies** must meet strict embedded device criteria
- **Optional dependencies** should be avoided - prefer feature detection patterns

**Example Dependency Decision Framework:**
```python
# GOOD: Using existing Pillow for pixel operations
from PIL import Image
pixel_buffer = Image.new('RGB', (128, 64)).tobytes()

# BAD: Adding numpy just for array operations
# import numpy as np
# pixel_array = np.zeros((64, 128, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

# GOOD: Native Python for simple data structures
data_buffer = bytearray(128 * 64 * 3)

# BAD: Adding pandas for simple data operations
# import pandas as pd
# df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

**Embedded Device Memory Budget:**
- **Total Application Budget:** <100MB
- **tinyDisplay Framework:** <20MB
- **Core Dependencies (asteval + Pillow):** ~10-15MB
- **Application Code & Data:** ~65-75MB
- **System Overhead Buffer:** ~10MB

This strict dependency management ensures tinyDisplay remains suitable for resource-constrained embedded devices while providing necessary functionality.
