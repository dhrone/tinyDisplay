# Project Brief: tinyDisplay Refactor

## Introduction / Problem Statement

tinyDisplay is a specialized display framework designed for Single Board Computers (SBCs) driving small embedded displays, typically under 256x128 pixel resolution. The project addresses a gap in existing display frameworks which assume high-resolution devices and framebuffer-based systems, making them unsuitable for small displays that require specialized interface logic (handled by projects like luma.oled and luma.lcd).

Originally created to replace basic display software for a RaspberryPi-based music player, tinyDisplay has evolved into a sophisticated framework for managing dynamic content through widgets, animations, and data-driven updates. The project serves dual purposes: creating a practical tool for small display applications and providing a platform for experimenting with development methodologies and concepts.

The current challenge is that tinyDisplay is in a mid-refactor state where core architectural improvements are partially implemented. While the system demonstrates strong capabilities in marquee animations and dynamic value management, critical components including widget integration with the dependency management system, the application DSL implementation, and multiprocessing capabilities remain incomplete, with some core components currently failing unit tests.

## Vision & Goals

**Vision:** Create a robust, educational, and community-useful framework that makes sophisticated display programming accessible for small embedded displays, while serving as a platform for exploring advanced development methodologies.

**Primary Goals for Completion (Target: End of June 2025):**
1. **Stabilize Core Architecture:** Restore all unit tests to passing state and complete the widget-dependency management system integration
2. **Complete Application DSL:** Implement the comprehensive application DSL supporting layout, animation, data sources, and validation
3. **Enable Multiprocessing:** Implement multiprocessing capabilities for performance and responsiveness
4. **Achieve Performance Targets:** Render at 60 fps on RaspberryPi Zero 2W with efficient resource utilization
5. **Establish Structured Development:** Use BMAD methodology to create clear roadmap and development processes

**Success Metrics (Research-Informed):**
- All unit tests passing consistently
- 60 fps rendering capability on RaspberryPi Zero 2W (validated as achievable with Ring Buffers + SQLite)
- Memory usage under 200MB during normal operations (170-200MB allocated for hybrid architecture)
- Dynamic value evaluation under 1ms per expression (4-10x improvement with asteval)
- Dependency update propagation under 100Î¼s (RxPY reactive system)
- Partial screen updates: only redraw changed screen portions ("Smart Immediate Mode")
- Application DSL can define complex display scenarios with data integration
- Documentation enables effective development workflow
- Successful PyPI package distribution
