## Dev Technical Guidance

### Architecture Foundation
This story establishes the core architectural foundation based on Timmy's migration design. The key architectural components are:

**Ring Buffer System:**
- Implement as circular buffer with configurable size
- Thread-safe operations using locks or lock-free algorithms
- Memory-efficient with pre-allocated buffers
- Support for multiple data types (numeric, string, binary)
- Reference: See `MIGRATION_README.md` sections on ring buffer architecture

**SQLite Integration:**
- Use WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) mode for better concurrency
- Optimize for embedded usage with appropriate PRAGMA settings
- Schema design should support reactive data patterns
- Connection pooling for multi-threaded access
- Reference: See `docs/tech-stack.md` Database Layer section

**asteval Security Configuration:**
- Disable dangerous operations (loops, imports, file operations)
- Set memory and time limits appropriate for embedded devices
- Remove dangerous built-ins from symbol table
- Implement expression validation before evaluation
- Reference: See `docs/operational-guidelines.md` Security Practices section

### Project Structure Requirements
Follow the exact structure defined in `docs/project-structure.md`:

```
src/tinydisplay/
├── __init__.py              # Package initialization
├── core/                    # Core framework components
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── ring_buffer.py       # High-performance data flow
│   ├── reactive.py          # Reactive data binding system (placeholder)
│   ├── database.py          # SQLite integration layer
│   ├── expressions.py       # asteval expression evaluation
│   └── performance.py       # Performance monitoring (placeholder)
```

### Performance Considerations
- Target 60fps performance on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- Memory usage <100MB for typical applications
- Ring buffer operations should be O(1)
- Database operations should use prepared statements
- Expression evaluation should be cached when possible

### Testing Strategy
Follow the testing patterns in `docs/operational-guidelines.md`:
- Unit tests for each component with >90% coverage
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Performance tests for critical paths
- Security tests for asteval configuration
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Dependencies and Versions
Use exact versions specified in `docs/tech-stack.md` (updated):
- `asteval>=0.9.28,<1.0.0`
- `pillow>=9.0.0,<11.0.0`
- Development dependencies as specified

**Note:** Numpy dependency removed - not needed for small display pixel operations. Pillow provides sufficient image handling capabilities, and pure Python types (bytes, bytearray) are adequate for small pixel buffers on embedded devices.

### Migration Tool Integration
This foundation will be used by the migration tool in Story 1.3. Ensure:
- Ring buffer API is compatible with migration tool expectations
- Database schema supports migrated data structures
- Expression evaluation can handle legacy expression patterns

### Error Handling
Implement the error hierarchy from `docs/operational-guidelines.md`:
- `TinyDisplayError` as base exception
- `ConfigurationError` for setup issues
- `DataBindingError` for ring buffer/database issues
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

### Documentation Requirements
- All public APIs must have Google-style docstrings
- Include usage examples in docstrings
- Update `docs/index.md` with foundation status
- Document any deviations from planned architecture
