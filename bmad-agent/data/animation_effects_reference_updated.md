# üåÄ Animation Effects Reference for Custom Python System

This guide organizes common animation effects into categories relevant for UI/UX and game animation systems. Each effect includes a name, description, and high-level implementation strategy. Inspired by systems like Unity, CSS, Flutter, and custom engines.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time-based Animation Effects

| **Effect Name** | **Description** | **High-Level Implementation** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Fade (Opacity)** | Gradually changes an element‚Äôs opacity (e.g., fade-in/fade-out). | Interpolate alpha value over time (0 to 1 or vice versa). |
| **Scale (Size)** | Enlarges or shrinks the element. Common for hover or entrance effects. | Multiply width/height or transform scale matrix over time. |
| **Translate (Move/Slide)** | Moves the element from one position to another. | Interpolate position (x/y) values over time. |
| **Rotate (Spin)** | Spins or rotates an element around an origin. | Interpolate rotation angle; apply transform or image rotation. |
| **Marquee (Scroll/Loop)** | Continuously scrolls content across the screen in a loop, often used for tickers, banners, or image strips. | Continuously update x/y position. Reset when content exits viewport to loop. Duplicate content for seamless scrolling. |
| **Boundary-aware Translate** | Moves an element within bounds and reacts at edges‚Äîby bouncing or wrapping. | Update position by velocity. If bounds exceeded, invert velocity (bounce) or reset to opposite edge (wrap). |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Physics-based Animation Effects

| **Effect Name** | **Description** | **High-Level Implementation** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Bounce** | Causes the element to overshoot and rebound before settling. | Use bounce easing or simulate spring + floor collision. |
| **Spring** | Creates an overshoot-and-settle motion like a spring. | Damped harmonic oscillator or spring physics simulation. |
| **Gravity (Drop)** | Object accelerates downward like a falling item. | Apply constant acceleration: `position += velocity; velocity += gravity`. |
| **Inertia (Fling/Momentum)** | Continues motion after input, slowly decelerating. | Apply initial velocity and simulate drag/friction each frame. |

## üßÆ Procedural Animation Effects

| **Effect Name** | **Description** | **High-Level Implementation** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Wave (Oscillation)** | Repetitive up/down or left/right motion. | Use sine or cosine functions to offset position. |
| **Jitter (Shake)** | Quick, random or alternating small displacements. | Add rapid ¬± pixel shifts or random offsets each frame. |
| **Random Drift** | Smooth, random wandering over time. | Use Perlin noise or gradual random walk with inertia. |

## üß© Composite Animation Effects

| **Effect Name** | **Description** | **High-Level Implementation** |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Flip + Scale** | Flip with depth-enhancing scale. | Animate rotation + scale simultaneously. |
| **Squash & Stretch** | Simulates flexible mass (classic cartoon effect). | Non-uniform scale: compress one axis, expand the other, then reverse. |

## ‚è≥ Timing & Easing Functions

| **Easing Function** | **Description** | **High-Level Implementation** |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| **Linear** | Constant speed motion. | Uniform step size: `t += dt`. |
| **Ease-In-Out** | Starts/ends slow, fast in middle. | Cubic B√©zier or sinusoidal ease: `f(t) = -cos(œÄt)/2 + 0.5`. |
| **Back** | Overshoots target then returns. | Custom easing or B√©zier with control points beyond [0,1]. |
| **Elastic** | Bouncy, oscillating overshoot. | Damped sine wave: `A * e^(-kt) * sin(ft)`. |
| **Bounce (Ease)** | Multiple rebounds before settling. | Stepwise piecewise function simulating multiple bounce decays. |

## üí° Notes

- **Time-based** animations are simplest to implement with linear interpolation (`lerp`).
- **Physics-based** effects give motion a natural feel and often require simulating mass/spring dynamics.
- **Procedural** effects enable complex or randomized behaviors.
- **Composite** effects combine multiple transformations for richness.
- **Easing functions** modify the pacing of all animations.

These effects can be layered or sequenced to build expressive, smooth animations in your Pillow-based system.
