## Dev Technical Guidance

### Architecture Foundation
Based on the project structure (`docs/project-structure.md`) and operational guidelines (`docs/operational-guidelines.md`), implement the widget foundation following these patterns:

**Core Directory Structure:**
```
src/tinydisplay/
├── widgets/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── base.py              # Widget abstract base class
├── canvas/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── canvas.py           # Canvas base class
│   └── layering.py         # Z-order management
├── core/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── reactive.py         # Reactive data binding
├── rendering/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── engine.py           # Rendering engine
│   └── frame_timer.py      # 60fps timing
└── data/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── sources.py          # Data source abstractions
```

### Performance Requirements
From `docs/tech-stack.md`, target these performance metrics:
- **60fps sustained rendering** on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- **<100MB memory footprint** for typical applications
- **<50ms response time** for reactive updates
- **Efficient CPU usage** (<80% on single core)

### Reactive System Design
Implement reactive patterns following the ring buffer + SQLite architecture:

**ReactiveValue Implementation:**
```python
class ReactiveValue:
    """Reactive value with automatic dependency tracking."""
    
    def __init__(self, initial_value=None):
        self._value = initial_value
        self._observers = set()
        self._dependencies = set()
    
    def bind(self, observer):
        """Bind an observer to value changes."""
        self._observers.add(observer)
    
    def notify(self):
        """Notify all observers of value change."""
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.on_value_changed(self)
```

### Widget Base Class Design
Following operational guidelines (`docs/operational-guidelines.md`):

**Abstract Widget Pattern:**
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Optional, Tuple, Protocol

class Widget(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all widgets."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self._position: Tuple[int, int] = (0, 0)
        self._size: Tuple[int, int] = (100, 20)
        self._visible: bool = True
        self._alpha: float = 1.0
        self._z_order: int = 0
        self._dirty: bool = True
        self._reactive_bindings: Dict[str, ReactiveValue] = {}
    
    @abstractmethod
    def render(self, canvas: 'Canvas') -> None:
        """Render the widget to the canvas."""
        pass
    
    def bind_data(self, property_name: str, reactive_value: ReactiveValue):
        """Bind a reactive value to a widget property."""
        self._reactive_bindings[property_name] = reactive_value
        reactive_value.bind(self._on_data_changed)
```

### Canvas Composition System
Implement canvas following the composition patterns:

**Canvas Management:**
```python
class Canvas:
    """Canvas for widget composition and rendering."""
    
    def __init__(self, width: int, height: int):
        self._width = width
        self._height = height
        self._widgets: List[Widget] = []
        self._layer_manager = LayerManager()
        self._dirty_regions: Set[Tuple[int, int, int, int]] = set()
    
    def add_widget(self, widget: Widget, z_order: int = 0):
        """Add a widget to the canvas."""
        self._widgets.append(widget)
        self._layer_manager.add_layer(widget, z_order)
        self._mark_dirty()
```

### Integration with Foundation Components
Leverage completed stories (1.1, 1.2, 1.3):

**Ring Buffer Integration (Story 1.1):**
- Use ring buffer classes for data stream management
- Implement reactive data flow using established patterns
- Leverage SQLite integration for widget state persistence

**DSL Framework Integration (Story 1.2):**
- Ensure widget base classes support DSL generation patterns
- Implement widget creation methods compatible with DSL syntax
- Follow established DSL validation patterns

**Migration Tool Integration (Story 1.3):**
- Design widget base classes to support migration from legacy widgets
- Implement widget factory patterns for migration tool usage
- Ensure compatibility with generated DSL applications

### Testing Strategy
Following operational guidelines testing requirements (>90% coverage):

**Unit Tests:**
- Widget base class functionality
- Canvas composition operations
- Reactive data binding behavior
- Z-order management
- Lifecycle management

**Integration Tests:**
- Widget + Canvas integration
- Reactive data flow end-to-end
- Rendering pipeline integration
- Performance under load

**Performance Tests:**
- 60fps rendering validation
- Memory usage profiling
- Reactive update latency
- Pi Zero 2W compatibility

### Error Handling and Edge Cases
Implement robust error handling:

**Widget Lifecycle Errors:**
- Handle widget initialization failures
- Manage memory allocation errors
- Graceful degradation for rendering failures

**Reactive System Errors:**
- Circular dependency detection
- Invalid data type handling
- Thread safety for concurrent updates

**Canvas Management Errors:**
- Widget bounds validation
- Z-order conflict resolution
- Memory limits for large widget counts
