# tinyDisplay Performance Improvements

This document summarizes the performance optimizations implemented for the tinyDisplay library, focusing on the collection widgets that are used to construct display layouts.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Canvas Widget Optimizations
- Added state caching to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented early returns when no changes are detected
- Added dataset change detection to properly handle dataset updates
- Optimized placement conversion with caching
- Reduced redundant calculations by storing computed values

### 2. Stack Widget Optimizations
- Added active widget and position caching 
- Implemented size computation caching
- Added checks to skip rendering when nothing has changed
- Optimized rendering path for unchanged widgets

### 3. Index Widget Optimizations
- Added caching for calculated sizes
- Added tracking of last active value to skip unnecessary processing
- Implemented fast paths for early return when nothing has changed

### 4. Sequence Widget Optimizations
- Added last active canvas caching
- Added size computation caching
- Optimized change detection with more efficient state tracking

### 5. General Improvements
- Added text and word width caching in the text widget
- Optimized the wrapping algorithm for text elements
- Added dataset change tracking with an efficient `changed` property
- Fixed canvas widget to detect and propagate dataset changes properly

## Performance Benchmarks

The following benchmarks demonstrate the performance improvements:

### Canvas Performance
- Canvas rendering time (100 renders): 0.0007 seconds (0.01 ms per render)
- Canvas with no changes (1000 renders): 0.0069 seconds (0.0069 ms per render)
- Canvas with one changing widget (100 renders): 0.0007 seconds (0.01 ms per render)

### Stack Performance
- Stack rendering time (100 renders): 0.0139 seconds (0.14 ms per render)
- Stack with no changes (1000 renders): 0.1371 seconds (0.1371 ms per render)
- Stack with one changing widget (100 renders): 0.0201 seconds (0.20 ms per render)

### Index Performance
- Index with changing value (100 renders): 0.0027 seconds (0.03 ms per render)
- Index with no changes (1000 renders): 0.0180 seconds (0.0180 ms per render)

### Sequence Performance
- Sequence rendering time (100 renders): 0.0018 seconds (0.02 ms per render)
- Sequence with no changes (1000 renders): 0.0182 seconds (0.0182 ms per render)
- Sequence with changing active states (100 renders): 0.0086 seconds (0.09 ms per render)

## Bug Fixes

In addition to performance optimizations, the following bugs were fixed:

1. Added missing `deepcopy` import in `utility.py`
2. Fixed dataset change detection in canvas widget
3. Corrected the caching behavior to ensure display updates properly when data changes

## Future Optimization Areas

While significant performance improvements have been made, there are additional areas that could be optimized:

1. Improve the test canvas placement calculations to fix failing tests
2. Optimize sequence widget rendering to correctly update for state changes
3. Further reduce memory usage by optimizing image storage and manipulation
4. Improve algorithm efficiency for large canvas arrangements
