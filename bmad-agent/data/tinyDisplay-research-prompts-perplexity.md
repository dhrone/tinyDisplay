Platform: Optimized for Perplexity research execution

## Research Query 1: Python Data Layer Alternatives for Embedded Systems

**Query for Perplexity:**

Research Python data management libraries suitable for embedded systems with 512MB RAM that need 60fps performance. Focus on:

1. **Memory-efficient alternatives to pandas**: polars, vaex, dask minimal configs
2. **Time-series libraries with history tracking**: InfluxDB Python client, custom ring buffers
3. **Reactive data systems**: RxPY, asyncio-based solutions, observer patterns
4. **SQLite optimizations** for memory-constrained environments
5. **Performance benchmarks** for small dataset operations

**Specific requirements:**
- Must support accessing previous versions of data (time-series)
- Need dependency tracking and change notifications
- Target: RaspberryPi Zero 2W (512MB RAM)
- Performance: 60fps rendering capability

Create a comparison table with memory usage, performance characteristics, and integration complexity.

## Research Query 2: Python Expression Evaluation and Templating Libraries

**Query for Perplexity:**

Research Python libraries for expression evaluation and data templating in performance-critical applications. Focus on:

1. **Expression evaluation alternatives**: simpleeval, RestrictedPython, AST optimizations
2. **Reactive programming libraries**: RxPY, PyQt property binding, asyncio reactive streams
3. **Lightweight template engines**: Jinja2 performance optimizations, Mako, Chameleon
4. **Data binding frameworks**: Vue.js-inspired Python implementations, MobX-style reactivity
5. **Performance optimization techniques**: bytecode compilation, expression caching, lazy evaluation

**Specific requirements:**
- Must handle frequent re-evaluation (60fps target)
- Need dependency tracking for automatic updates
- Support for time-series data expressions
- Low memory overhead for embedded systems

Compare performance characteristics, syntax complexity, and integration requirements.

## Research Query 3: Python Display Frameworks for Small Embedded Displays

**Query for Perplexity:**

Research Python display and UI frameworks suitable for small embedded displays (under 256x128 resolution) on Single Board Computers. Focus on:

1. **Python display frameworks**: Kivy, Pygame, Tkinter embedded usage, PyQt/PySide minimal
2. **Embedded display solutions**: CircuitPython libraries, MicroPython frameworks, Adafruit libraries
3. **Animation systems**: CSS-inspired animations, game engine UI approaches, immediate vs retained mode
4. **DSL approaches**: QML, XAML-inspired Python solutions, JSON/YAML configurations
5. **Performance optimizations**: rendering pipelines, caching strategies, multi-threading approaches
6. **luma.oled ecosystem** and related SBC display libraries

**Specific requirements:**
- Must work on RaspberryPi Zero 2W (512MB RAM)
- Target resolution: under 256x128 pixels
- Need smooth animations and dynamic content
- Python 3 based solutions only

Create feature comparison matrix and identify architectural patterns applicable to small display optimization.

## Execution Instructions for Perplexity

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Copy one query at a time** from above
2. **Paste into Perplexity** and execute
3. **Save results** to individual files:
   - `bmad-agent/data/perplexity-data-layer-findings.md`
   - `bmad-agent/data/perplexity-templating-findings.md`
   - `bmad-agent/data/perplexity-display-frameworks-findings.md`

**Recommended Order:**
1. Display Frameworks (Query 3) - validates market positioning
2. Data Layer (Query 1) - foundational architecture decision  
3. Templating (Query 2) - builds on data layer findings

**Follow-up Questions for Perplexity:**
- "Can you provide specific memory usage numbers for these libraries?"
- "Are there any recent performance benchmarks comparing these options?"
- "Which of these have active communities and recent updates?"
