## Dev Technical Guidance

### Current Migration Tool Architecture
Based on analysis of `migration_tool.py` and `migration_generator.py`, the current system provides:

**SystemAnalyzer Class (`migration_tool.py`):**
- Analyzes existing codebase structure and extracts widget information
- Identifies data streams and dynamic value expressions
- Captures display configuration and project structure
- Outputs `SystemAnalysis` dataclass with comprehensive legacy system information

**CodeGenerator Class (`migration_generator.py`):**
- Currently generates JSON-based configurations and reactive architecture
- Uses `CodeTemplates` class for code generation patterns
- Creates directory structure and supporting files
- Generates migrated widgets but in JSON format

### DSL Generation Requirements
The enhancement must modify the code generation to output DSL syntax instead of JSON:

**Target DSL Patterns (from Story 1.2 validation):**
```python
# Widget Composition DSL
canvas = Canvas(width=128, height=64)
canvas.add(
    Text("Hello World").position(10, 10).z_order(1),
    ProgressBar(value=data.cpu_usage).position(10, 30).z_order(2)
)

# Animation Coordination DSL
text1.animate.scroll().sync('group_a')
progress1.animate.fill().then(progress2.animate.fill())
animation_group.barrier('all_ready').then(canvas.animate.fade_in())

# Reactive Data Binding DSL
widget.bind_value(data.sensor_reading)
widget.bind_visibility(data.alert_active)
```

**Legacy JSON Format (Current Output):**
```json
{
  "widgets": [
    {
      "type": "text", "content": "Hello World",
      "position": {"x": 10, "y": 10}, "z_order": 1
    }
  ],
  "animations": [
    {"type": "slide_in", "sync_group": "startup_sequence"}
  ]
}
```

### Technical Implementation Strategy

**1. DSL Template System Enhancement:**
- Extend `CodeTemplates` class with DSL-specific generation methods
- Create widget-specific DSL templates for each widget type identified in analysis
- Implement method chaining generation for positioning, styling, and animation
- Add canvas composition templates with proper widget hierarchy

**2. Widget Analysis Enhancement:**
- Enhance `SystemAnalyzer._extract_widgets_from_ast()` to capture animation patterns
- Improve dynamic value extraction to identify reactive binding opportunities
- Add marquee animation pattern recognition for legacy scroll effects
- Capture widget dependency relationships for proper DSL ordering

**3. Animation Pattern Recognition:**
- Analyze legacy marquee implementations for scroll timing and direction
- Identify fade, slide, and transition patterns in existing codebase
- Extract animation coordination patterns (sequential, parallel, synchronized)
- Map legacy animation triggers to new DSL coordination primitives

**4. Reactive Binding Conversion:**
- Convert legacy `DynamicValue` expressions to asteval-compatible syntax
- Map legacy data source connections to ring buffer subscriptions
- Transform manual widget updates to reactive binding patterns
- Ensure thread-safe reactive patterns in generated DSL

### Integration with Foundation Components
**Ring Buffer Integration (from Story 1.1):**
- Use ring buffer classes for data stream management in generated applications
- Generate ring buffer subscriptions for reactive data binding
- Implement proper buffer sizing based on legacy data usage patterns

**SQLite Integration (from Story 1.1):**
- Generate SQLite schema for persistent widget state management
- Convert legacy configuration persistence to SQLite storage patterns
- Implement state recovery and initialization in generated DSL applications

**asteval Security (from Story 1.1):**
- Ensure all generated expressions comply with asteval security policies
- Convert legacy dynamic expressions to safe asteval syntax
- Implement expression validation in migration tool output

```

### Testing Strategy
**Migration Accuracy Testing:**
- Compare legacy application behavior with migrated DSL application behavior
- Validate widget positioning, sizing, and visual appearance
- Test animation timing and coordination accuracy
- Verify data binding and reactive update functionality

**Performance Validation:**
- Benchmark migration tool execution time with various legacy application sizes
- Compare memory usage between legacy and migrated applications
- Validate 60fps performance target on Pi Zero 2W with migrated applications
- Test migration tool scalability with complex legacy applications

- **Migration README:** DSL examples and architecture patterns for generation templates
- **Story 1.1 Implementation:** Ring buffer, SQLite, and asteval integration patterns
- **Story 1.2 Validation:** DSL vs JSON comparison results and preferred DSL patterns
- **Legacy Backup Directory:** Source material for migration testing and validation
- **Operational Guidelines:** Code generation standards and quality requirements

### Success Criteria Validation
The enhanced migration tool must demonstrate:
1. **Clean DSL Generation:** Generated code follows established DSL patterns from Story 1.2
2. **Migration Accuracy:** >95% functional equivalence between legacy and migrated applications
3. **Performance Maintenance:** Migrated applications meet 60fps target on embedded devices
4. **Developer Productivity:** 10x improvement in migration speed compared to manual conversion
5. **Code Quality:** Generated DSL passes all linting, formatting, and security validation

### Error Handling & Edge Case Management

**Migration Failure Recovery:**
- Implement comprehensive error logging with specific failure categorization
- Create rollback mechanisms for partial migrations that restore original state
- Generate detailed migration reports identifying successful and failed conversions
- Provide manual intervention points for complex legacy patterns that cannot be automatically converted

**Edge Case Handling Strategies:**
- **Unsupported Legacy Patterns:** Generate commented placeholder code with manual conversion instructions
- **Custom Widget Types:** Create generic widget templates with property mapping for manual refinement
- **Complex Dependencies:** Generate dependency graphs and warn about circular or unresolvable dependencies
- **Corrupted Legacy Code:** Implement syntax validation and provide repair suggestions or skip options

**Validation & Quality Assurance:**
- Pre-migration validation to check legacy code completeness and syntax
- Post-migration validation to ensure generated DSL code compiles and executes
- Automated testing of migrated applications against original functionality
- Performance regression testing to ensure migrated applications meet performance targets

### Dependencies and Prerequisites
- **Story 1.1 Complete:** Foundation components (ring buffer, SQLite, asteval) must be functional
- **Story 1.2 Complete:** DSL validation framework provides preferred patterns and templates
- **Legacy Codebase Access:** Existing migration tools and legacy backup for testing
- **DSL Pattern Library:** Established DSL syntax and patterns from validation framework
