class DependencyManager:
    """Manages dependencies between objects and dispatches change events.
    
    The DependencyManager is the core class that handles the registration of dependencies,
    event propagation, and change notification in a reactive programming model. It maintains
    a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependencies where:
    - Nodes represent observable objects and their dependents
    - Edges represent "depends on" relationships (A â†’ B means "B depends on A")
    
    Key Features:
    - Automatic cycle detection and resolution
    - Batched event processing
    - Support for weak references to prevent memory leaks
    - Namespacing support for isolated dependency graphs
    - Thread-safe operations
    
    Example:
        >>> manager = DependencyManager()
        >>> 
        >>> class DataSource:
        ...     def __init__(self, manager):
        ...         self.manager = manager
        ...     def update(self, value):
        ...         self.manager.raise_event(ChangeEvent("data_updated", self, value))
        >>>
        >>> class DataProcessor(ChangeProcessorProtocol):
        ...     def process_change(self, events):
        ...         for event in events:
        ...             print(f"Processed: {event.data}")
        >>>
        >>> source = DataSource(manager)
        >>> processor = DataProcessor()
        >>> manager.register(processor, source)

            namespace_filter: Optional set of namespaces to filter events by. If specified,
                           only events matching these namespaces will be processed.
                           This is particularly useful in multi-tenant applications.
                           
            intra_tick_cascade: If True (default), events raised during processing will be

                             Set to False to process only the current event queue.
                             
            delegate_to_namespaces: If True (default), the global manager will delegate
                                 events to registered namespaces. This allows for
                                 hierarchical event processing where global events can
                                 be handled by specific namespaces.
        
        Example:
            # Basic usage
            manager.dispatch_events()
            
            # With visibility filtering

            manager.dispatch_events(namespace_filter={"user1"})
            
        Note:
            - This method is not reentrant. Nested calls will be processed after the
              current batch completes.
            - Performance is optimized when the visibility set remains stable between
              calls, as it caches the pruned dependency graph.
